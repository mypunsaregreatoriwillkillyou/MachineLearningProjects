# MachineLearningProjects

- [Linear Regression](LinearRegression_.ipynb): In this notebook, we train a Linear Regression model on an Ecommerce dataset.
- [Decision Trees](DecisionTrees.ipynb): In this notebook, we train a Decision Tree model on a Loan Approval dataset.
- [Support Vector Machines](SupportVectorMachines.ipynb): In this notebook, we train an SVM model on a Customer Churn dataset.


In all the above notebooks, we perform some preprocessing including handling missing values, scaling numeric data, encoding categorical data, and preprocessing as per the dataset given.
